Court finds age 50+, without any underlying condition, unpersuasive as reason to release. ""Similar to Adams and Morris, Defendant cites his age as an exceptional circumstance given the potential of a COVID-19 outbreak in his facility and his increased vulnerability to the virus. Defendant is 50 years of age. While he may be older than the typical defendant in federal court, he does not fall within the category of persons who are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. The court understands that no age group is immune to COVID-19, but all health and scientific information that this court has read and researched shows that persons over 60 years of age are the most vulnerable and at greater risk of contracting COVID-19. As Defendant’s age falls well below the threshold for an increased risk of contracting COVID-19, the court finds his argument unavailing.""

Not exceptional case, speculative concerns about outbreak in facility. ""Defendant also fails to demonstrate that his concerns raise an exceptional circumstance as to him in particular. While the court understands Defendant’s concerns during these trying times, the fear of a COVID-19 outbreak at his facility is not unique to the prison population, as virtually any person confined at a jail or prison would have the same concerns. Instead, he relies on the speculative assertion that a COVID-19 outbreak is likely to occur at his facility without any particularized evidence to support that assertion. Any detainee would be exposed to the same risk that Defendant presents, and, as other courts have also concluded, the court cannot not release every detainee who may be at risk of contracting COVID-19, as it would then be required to release all detainees.

Plaintiffs also ask us to require Defendants to release or relocate inmates who, because of their age or other medical conditions, are at a high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19.

New constitutional violation, rather than a modification of 2009 order: If it’s a modification of the old order, then the least intrusive/reasonable time requirements of § 3626(a)(3)(A)(i)–(ii) may already be satisfied. The court reasoned that here, the 2009 population reduction order could not have contemplated this particular threat. “We therefore conclude that to the extent Plaintiffs can establish a constitutional violation based on the threat posed by COVID-19, it must be based on shortcomings in Defendants’ response to the virus, not on the longstanding systemic constitutional deficiencies in California’s prison health care delivery system.”

No prejudice, encouraged further litigation at the trial court level, and encouraged CDCR to take further steps: “Our order today does not leave Plaintiffs without options for seeking relief. While we must deny their motion as currently procedurally improper, we do so without prejudice to their bringing their request for relief in an appropriate forum. …Plaintiffs may go before a single judge to press their claim that Defendants ’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic is constitutionally inadequate.” … “We emphasize that Defendants have broad authority to voluntarily take steps that may prevent the life-threatening spread of COVID-19 within their prisons, and we recognize the deference that is due to prison authorities to determine which additional measures must be taken to avoid catastrophic results“",,https://bit.ly/2Kqj7Rn

This Class includes two subclasses. Subclass A consists of all people who, because of age or previous medical conditions, are at particularly grave risk of harm from COVID-19. Subclass B consists of all people who are currently housed on a tier where someone has already tested positive for the coronavirus.
 
 Partial Denial of TRO: Court ""issues a temporary restraining order, though considerably narrower than the order the plaintiffs have requested. In particular, the Court declines the plaintiffs' request to require the Sheriff to move certain of them to other forms of custodial arrangements such as home incarceration."" 
 
 Court leaves open motion for preliminary injunction pending discovery. 
 
 Habeas: "" In sum, the habeas corpus claim on the part of the representatives of subclass A is barred due to their failure to exhaust available state court remedies. As a result, the subclass has no likelihood of success on the merits."" Some useful dicta suggesting that in 7th circuit, habeas may be used to challenge conditions of confinement: ""Were the Court required to address this point, it would not consider it to be an absolute bar to plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order. The plaintiffs' claims, as they have framed them, do bear on the duration of their confinement (they contend, ultimately, that they cannot be held in the Jail consistent with the Constitution's requirements), and they are not the sort of claims that are, or can be, appropriately addressed via a claim for damages."" 
 
 1983: Reasonably likely to succeed on the merits. 
 
 Outcome: Court grants relief on internal measures (testing, santiation, social distancing during intake) but denies relief on any release or transfer.",,https://bit.ly/2KpCHxf
