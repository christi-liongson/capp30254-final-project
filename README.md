## Overview
### The problem
According to data collected by the New York Times, many of the largest outbreaks of the coronavirus are in carceral sites - correctional institutions, prison systems and jails. The close quarters make it impossible for inmates and staff alike to follow physical distancing guidelines. Advocates across the country have rallied around a decarceration campaign, pressuring attorneys general and sheriffsâ€™ offices to release prisoners for the sake of public health. At the same time, skeptics have raised questions about public safety and crime rates.
### The question(s):
Can we predict the death rate/rate of infection in the prison population without decarceration? Can we predict recidivism rates, with respect to violent crime, if people are de-carcerated? And what qualitative analysis can we contribute to this urgent conversation?

## Installation:
To install required packages, run the following command in your command-line interface:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To view the Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and analysis, run the following command in your command-line interface to open Jupyter notebooks in your browser from the main project folder:

```
cd analysis
jupyter notebook
```

## Directory:

  - files:

North Carolina's Department of Public Safety (NCDPS) releases ["all public information on all NC Department of Public Safety offenders convicted since 1972."](http://webapps6.doc.state.nc.us/opi/downloads.do?method=view) Before running the following modules or notebooks, download all tables and store them as CSVs. (Note: this will require around 5 GB of storage). Run ```./ncdoc_parallel.sh``` to store the data in the ```preprocessed/``` directory. For more information, see [ncdoc_data](https://github.com/jtwalsh0/ncdoc_data) project by jtwalsh0.

#### Files (Public Safety)
  - config.py: contains CSV locations and constants e.g., seed, CSV names, etc.
  - main.py: builds, populates, and queries a SQLite3 database by calling
             the following modules
    - create_db.py: establishes a connection and creates tables
    - populate_db.py: inserts records into database tables
    - query_db.py: executes SQL queries on the database
  - build_dataset.py: queries tables in database, constructs flags and additional
                      features, outputs a CSV
  - features_process_analysis.py: prepares data for, and conducts, analysis using
                                  functions from the following module
    - pipeline.py: contains functions to perform imputation, one-hot encoding, etc.
  - classification.py: runs classification models, outputs precision-recall curves
                       and the most important features
  - model_selection.ipynb: finds the best model(s) and returns evaluation metrics

#### Data (Public Safety)
  - coding_offenses.xls: categorizes offense labels from the NCDPS based on extent of
                         harm on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the least likely and
                         5 is most likely
  - data_1yr.csv: pre-processed output from ```build()``` in build_dataset, where
                  recidivism is defined as reincarceration within one year of
                  release
  - data_3yr.csv: pre-processed output from ```build()``` in build_dataset, where
                  recidivism is defined as reincarceration within three years of
                  release

#### Files (Public Health)
  - clean_data.py: functions to transform data for machine learning. Functions
                   include one-hot-encoding and normalizing data. 
  - prison_conditions_wrangle.py: functions to clean and wrangle data from the UCLA
                                  COVID in Prisons dataset and the Bureau of Justice Statistics
  - build_prison_conditions_df.py: functions to build dataframes on prison capacity,
                                   prison population numbers, COVID-19 related social distancing policies in
                                   prisons, and mitigation policies to address the adverse effects of isolation
                                  on prisoners. 
  - ph_analysis.py: functions to run a series of ML models on the COVID in prisons 
                    dataset. Functions include temporally splitting the data, running a 
                    temporal cross validation grid search to tune hyperparameters, training and
                    testing several models, and selecting and evaluating the best predictors of
                    COVID-19 cases in prisons. 
  - prison_data_processing.ipynb: a Jupyter Notebook walking through the process of
                                  building the COVID in Prisons data set, and running the Machine Learning
                                  analysis.
