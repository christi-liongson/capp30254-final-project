# COVID-19: Decarceration and Public Health
CAPP 30254 Machine Learning Final Project
Team Members: Christi Liongson, Hana Passen, Charmaine Runes, Damini Sharma 

## Overview
### The problem
According to data collected by the New York Times, many of the largest outbreaks of the coronavirus are in carceral sites - correctional institutions, prison systems and jails. The close quarters make it impossible for inmates and staff alike to follow physical distancing guidelines. Advocates across the country have rallied around a decarceration campaign, pressuring attorneys general and sheriffsâ€™ offices to release prisoners for the sake of public health. At the same time, skeptics have raised questions about public safety and crime rates.
### The question(s):
Can we predict the death rate/rate of infection in the prison population without decarceration? Can we predict recidivism rates, with respect to violent crime, if people are de-carcerated? And what qualitative analysis can we contribute to this urgent conversation? 

#### Libraries: 
- numpy
- pandas
- chardet

#### Modules: 
- clean_data.py: functions to transform data for machine learning. Functions
    include one-hot-encoding and normalizing data. 

- prison_conditions_wrangle.py: functions to clean and wrangle data from the UCLA
    COVID in Prisons dataset and the Bureau of Justice Statistics
    
- build_prison_conditions_df.py: functions to build dataframes on prison capacity,
    prison population numbers, COVID-19 related social distancing policies in
    prisons, and mitigation policies to address the adverse effects of isolation
    on prisoners. 

- ph_analysis.py: functions to run a series of ML models on the COVID in prisons 
    dataset. Functions include temporally splitting the data, running a 
    temporal cross validation grid search to tune hyperparameters, training and
    testing several models, and selecting and evaluating the best predictors of
    COVID-19 cases in prisons. 

- prison_data_processing.ipynb: a Jupyter Notebook walking through the process of
    building the COVID in Prisons data set, and running the Machine Learning
    analysis.
