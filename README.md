## Overview
### The problem
According to data collected by the New York Times, many of the largest outbreaks of the coronavirus are in carceral sites - correctional institutions, prison systems and jails. The close quarters make it impossible for inmates and staff alike to follow physical distancing guidelines. Advocates across the country have rallied around a decarceration campaign, pressuring attorneys general and sheriffsâ€™ offices to release prisoners for the sake of public health. At the same time, skeptics have raised questions about public safety and crime rates.
### The question(s):
Can we predict the death rate/rate of infection in the prison population without decarceration? Can we predict recidivism rates, with respect to violent crime, if people are de-carcerated? And what qualitative analysis can we contribute to this urgent conversation?
